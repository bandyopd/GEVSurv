# GEVSurv
R code to fit a h-likelihood based Accelerated failure time (AFT) Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model to clustered right-censored survival data, under heavy censoring

(a) GEV.R: implements the AFT-GEV model

(b) N.R: implements the AFT-Normal model 

Other files need to be placed in a directory, and sourced accordingly, as described in (a) and (b) 

(c) TeethG.csv: (Sample) Oral health dataset of 100 subjects

(d) TeethDictionary.txt: Description of the variables in TeethG.csv
